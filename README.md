# DMR (Distributed Message Rooms)

## Business case

Currently, there is no way to pass questions from one Bürokratt instance to another. This means that if an end-user asks a question that the local Bürokratt instance cannot answer, he will receive no meaningful reply — even if some other Bürokratt instance could answer it.

An example: a user comes to the Tax Authority web, and asks a question about crime, the Tax Authority instance will not be able to answer it. The Police instance **is able** to answer the question but there is no way to forward it.

So the goal is to built a system that can efficiently and securely forward questions and answers between Bürokratt instances.

## Key components

### DMR agents

- DMR agents run in every client's Bürokratt cluster. They are responsible for forwarding messages to the DMR Server and receiving messages from it in real-time. This is done via a WebSocket connection.
- DMR agents encrypt and decrypt messages using public-key cryptography. Private keys are delivered to the agents at infrastructure level. Other DMR agents' public keys are distributed by DMR server on establishing a WebSocket connection.
- Metadata needed to pass the messages along — like sender and recipient IDs — is not encrypted.
- The DMR agents also expose an API for communicating with other services in the client's Bürokratt cluster.

### DMR server

- Key functionality is to forward the messages between DMR agents using RabbitMQ.
- Uses WebSockets to exchange messages with DMR agents.
- Gets its configuration from CentOps. CentOps is developed separately and is **out of scope for this project**.
- Can also distribute configuration to DMR agents if necessary, namely a list of other DMR agents and their public keys.
- DMR server _itself_ is lightweight and stateless, it does not store any messages or configuration data in any sort of a DB.
- **Cannot** read the message contents, these are encrypted by the DMR agents.
- There can be several instances of DMR server running, depending on load.
- In the future, can potentially be extended to perform operations — like applying policies — on incoming and outgoing messages.
- Includes support for Prometheus-based monitoring to help track the real-time health and behavior of the DMR server, specifically around WebSocket activity and message processing.
- **Metrics endpoint**: [`http://localhost:${PORT}/metrics`](http://localhost:PORT/metrics) — compatible with Prometheus.

### RabbitMQ

- Has per-Agent message queues.
- Has a dead letter queue for messages that failed to deliver.
- Has RabbitMQ UI-based monitoring tools set up.
- Supports RabbitMQ clustering for scalability.

## Docker and Docker Compose

The DMR system can be easily deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. The repository includes Docker configurations for all components.

### Docker Files

- DMR Server Dockerfile: [`apps/dmr-server/Dockerfile`](apps/dmr-server/Dockerfile)
- DMR Agent Dockerfile: [`apps/dmr-agent/Dockerfile`](apps/dmr-agent/Dockerfile)

### Docker Compose

The main Docker Compose file is located at the root of the repository: [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml). Run with the following command from the root directory of the project:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Manual testing

You can test the whole flow of the solution this way:

1. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and run it with `ngrok http http://localhost:8080`.
2. Copy the URL provided by ngrok and set it as `OUTGOING_MESSAGE_ENDPOINT` for `dmr-agent-a` in `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Run `docker compose up -d`.
4. Run this command to send a message in [the proper format](#sending-messages) through `dmr-agent-b`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8074/v1/messages \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "id": "b1a7e8c2-1234-4f56-9abc-1234567890ab",
    "recipientId": "d3b07384-d9a0-4c3f-a4e2-123456789abc",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "type": "ChatMessage",
    "payload": {
      "chat": {
        "id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
        "created": "2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z"
      },
      "messages": [
        {
          "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
          "chatId": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
          "content": "example string 2",
          "authorTimestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
          "authorRole": "end-user"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

5. `dmr-agent-b` will forward this message to `dmr-server`. `dmr-server` will add it to the queue for `dmr-agent-a`. `dmr-agent-a` will receive it from `dmr-server` and forward it to the `OUTGOING_MESSAGE_ENDPOINT`. You should see the message in the ngrok tunnel.

## Environment Variables

Below is a list of all environment variables used by the DMR system, organized by service. Sensible variable values are also specified in the docker-compose file.

## Sending messages

DMR Agent will accept incoming messages on `/v1/messages` POST endpoint. It will forward outgoing messages to the `OUTGOING_MESSAGE_ENDPOINT`. See [DMR Agent variables](#dmr-agent-variables).

Messages endpoint supports versioning. The `v1` version message JSON structure is the following. This structure closely matches the DB schema of [Chatbot module](https://github.com/buerokratt/Buerokratt-Chatbot).

## RabbitMQ

### Queues

The RabbitMQ setup includes several types of queues to handle message routing and failure scenarios. All queues are **durable** and survive broker restarts. All messages are **persistent** so they are written to disk and survive broker restarts.

#### Normal Queues

- Each DMR agent has its own dedicated message queue for receiving messages.
- New agent queues are created when DMR server receives new agents in configuration from CentOps.
- Queue naming convention: `{agent-id}`. The agent ID (UUID) serves as the queue name.
- All queues are configured as quorum queues to support RabbitMQ clustering.
- Messages have configurable TTL (`RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_TTL`) with automatic expiration. Default is 5 minutes.

#### Dead Letter Queues (DLQs)

- Each agent queue has a corresponding dead letter queue: `{agent-id}.dlq`.
- DLQs are automatically created when setting up agent queues.
- Messages are moved to a DLQ if:
  - Sending messages fails due to some network error or similar — and retries are not successful.
  - Message TTL expires in the original queue.
- DLQs have their own TTL configuration (`RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_DLQ_TTL`) for automatic cleanup. Default is 24 hours.

#### Validation Failures Queue

- This is a **single** queue for all validation failures, it is not per-agent. The name is `validation-failures`.
- It is created on DMR Server start if it does not yet exist.
- Messages are moved to this queue if:
  - Message validation fails when DMR server receives an incoming message, e.g. if the message has no valid `recipientId`.
  - Recipient DMR agent is not able to decrypt the message.
- This queue has its own TTL configuration (`RABBITMQ_VALIDATION_FAILURES_TTL`) for automatic cleanup. Default is 24 hours.

### Kubernetes

Can be set up using [RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/using-operator). It supports declaratively deploy and manage RabbitMQ clusters on Kubernetes. Simplifies setup, scaling, and enables native support for Prometheus metrics via ServiceMonitor resources.

## Local development

For development purposes, there is also a simplified docker-compose file in the dmr-server directory: [`apps/dmr-server/docker-compose.yml`](apps/dmr-server/docker-compose.yml) which only sets up RabbitMQ for local development.

### Development

- `start:server`: Start the DMR server in development mode
- `start:agent`: Start the DMR agent in development mode

### Building

- `build`: Build all applications
- `build:server`: Build only the DMR server
- `build:agent`: Build only the DMR agent

### Testing

- `test`: Run tests for all applications
- `test:server`: Run tests for DMR server
- `test:agent`: Run tests for DMR agent
- `e2e`: Run end-to-end tests for all applications
- `e2e:server`: Run end-to-end tests for DMR server
- `e2e:agent`: Run end-to-end tests for DMR agent

For detailed test output, you can add the `--reporter=verbose` flag to any test command:

```bash
pnpm test:server -- --reporter=verbose
pnpm e2e:server -- --reporter=verbose
```

### Code Quality

- `lint`: Run ESLint on all files
- `lint:check`: Check for ESLint errors with zero warnings allowed
- `lint:fix`: Fix auto-fixable ESLint issues
- `format`: Format code using Prettier
- `format:check`: Check code formatting
